    <!-- Main content -->
    <p>Dear {{256901484__First name}},</p>

    <p>
      I am writing to introduce myself as your Placement Coordinator for the
      Diploma in Counselling Teenagers. I look forward to meeting you on your
      first day of term. Until then, I am getting in touch to offer some
      guidance so you can begin thinking about your counselling placement.
    </p>

      <p>
        Please note this email contains key information and links to essential
        forms - both for setting up your placement, and for use while you're on
        placement.
        <strong>I highly recommend you save this email securely</strong> so you
        can refer back to it when needed.

      <h2>Placement Allocation</h2>
    </div>

    <p>
      Below is a link to the placement allocation form, where you can indicate
      your placement availability and preferences. Before completing the form,
      please read the information below carefully as it will give you some
      understanding of how we set up placements, our placement requirements and
      answers to many questions you may have in mind.
    </p>

    <!-- Section heading -->
    <div class="part-heading">
      <h2>Setting up your placement</h2>
    </div>

    <p>
      We have many existing approved placement settings across the country and
      can usually find you a placement in your region (with some exceptions,
      where your input in the placement search will be necessary). As we have
      existing relationships with these placement settings, we are confident
      they will provide you with a supportive first placement.
    </p>

    <p>
      If however, you have a school or organisation in mind where you would like
      to do your placement, we can explore this option, but please note it will
      need to be a setting with no risk of dual relationships, and they will
      have to meet our criteria (below) and go through an approval process with
      IATE. You can provide details of the setting on the placement allocation
      form linked below.
    </p>

    <p>Our criteria for an appropriate first placement include:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Ideally having an existing counselling/therapy service in place, or able
        to demonstrate a therapeutically-minded approach (e.g. with other
        wellbeing interventions in place and a dedicated room for your
        counselling work to take place)
      </li>
      <li>
        A person who can act as your placement manager – ideally a qualified
        counsellor or psychotherapist, but can be someone working in pastoral
        care/mental health, available to meet with you regularly and complete
        six-monthly reports
      </li>
      <li>
        Having a dedicated room for your counselling sessions to take place,
        that is free from disruption, with art materials as well as lockable
        storage space to store confidential art work and records
      </li>
      <li>
        Agreement for you to work with parental consent for all clients under 18
      </li>
      <li>
        Permission for you to audio-record sessions for supervision and
        assessments (with consent)
      </li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Section heading -->
    <div class="part-heading">
      <h2>Working on placement</h2>
    </div>

    <p>
      Initially when you first begin your placement you will have a maximum of
      two clients. This will increase over time to a maximum of four or five,
      with the approval of your supervisor. All referrals your placement give
      you must be approved by your supervisor.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sessions are 50 minutes each and you will need time either side to
      prepare, clear up and make notes of the sessions. This means that
      initially your time commitment to your placement will likely be no more
      than a half day (usually a morning or afternoon) per week.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is recommended that you avoid working any clients who know each other
      well (classmates, siblings, friends).
    </p>

    <p>
      For your Diploma you need to accrue 100 hours with clients aged 12-25. You
      must be able to demonstrate work with clients across this range (at least
      one from the low end, middle and top end).
    </p>

      <h2>Next steps</h2>
    </div>

    <p>
      In order to begin the process of locating a suitable placement for you,
      please can you complete the placement allocation form:

        >PLACEMENT ALLOCATION FORM</a
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      Please complete it as soon as you are able to, and ideally by
      <strong>{DEADLINE}}</strong>.
    </p>

    <!-- Section heading -->
    <div class="part-heading">
      <h2>Placement Agreement</h2>
    </div>

    <p><em>(required only once setting is IATE approved and confirmed)</em></p>

    <p>
      Once you have a confirmed placement setting, that has been approved and
      agreed by IATE, you will need to sign a placement reciprocal agreement
      together with the placement, before any counselling work commences. Please
      note, this must be signed by both you and the placement director, before
      you start working with any clients on placements. The agreement is digital
      and can be accessed online by both parties.

    </p>

    <p>
      I look forward to meeting you at the start of term. Until then, if you
      have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask.
