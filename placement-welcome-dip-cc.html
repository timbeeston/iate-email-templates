    <!-- Main content -->
    <p>Dear {{256901484__First name}},</p>

    <p>
      I am writing to introduce myself as your Placement Coordinator for the
      Diploma in Child Counselling. I look forward to meeting you at the start
      of Year 2. I am getting in touch to offer some guidance so you can begin
      thinking about your Year 2 counselling placement.
    </p>

      <p>
        Please note this email contains key information and links to essential
        forms - both for setting up your placement, and for use while you're on
        placement.
        <strong>I highly recommend you save this email securely</strong> so you
        can refer back to it when needed.

      <h2>Placement Allocation</h2>
    </div>

    <p>
      Below is a link to the placement allocation form, where you can indicate
      your placement availability and preferences. Before completing the form,
      please read the information below carefully as it will give you some
      understanding of how we set up placements, our placement requirements and
      answers to many questions you may have in mind.
    </p>

    <!-- Section heading -->
    <div class="part-heading">
      <h2>Setting up your placement</h2>
    </div>

    <p>
      Your primary (first) clinical placement will start in January of Year 2
      and will be set up by IATE in settings (mostly schools) that are approved
      to meet IATE's placement requirements.
    </p>

    <p>
      We have many existing approved placement settings across the country and
      can usually find you a placement in your region (with some exceptions,
      where your input in the placement search will be necessary). As we have
      existing relationships with these placement settings, we are confident
      they will provide you with a supportive first placement.
    </p>

    <p>
      If, however, you have a school or organisation in mind where you would
      like to do your placement, we can explore this option, but please note
      they will have to meet our criteria (below) and go through an approval
      process with IATE. You can provide details of the setting on the placement
      allocation form (linked below).
    </p>

    <p>Our criteria for an appropriate first placement include:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Having an existing counselling/therapy service in place</li>
      <li>
        A person who can act as your placement manager who is a qualified
        counsellor or psychotherapist, available to meet with you regularly and
        to complete six-monthly reports
      </li>
      <li>
        Having a dedicated room for your counselling sessions to take place,
        that is free from disruption, with art and play materials as well as
        lockable storage space to store confidential artwork and records
      </li>
      <li>
        Opportunity for you to meet parents at the beginning and end of the work
      </li>
      <li>
        Permission for you to audio-record sessions for supervision and
        assessments
      </li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Section heading -->
    <div class="part-heading">
      <h2>Placement time commitment</h2>
    </div>

    <p>
      Sessions are 50 minutes each and you will need time either side to
      prepare, clear up and make notes of the sessions. Initially when you first
      begin your placement you will have a maximum of two clients. This will
      increase over time to a maximum of four or five, with the approval of your
      supervisor (all referrals your placement give you must be approved by your
      supervisor before you can work with them.) This means that initially your
      time commitment to your placement will likely be no more than a half day
      (usually a morning or afternoon) per week.
    </p>

    <!-- Section heading -->
    <div class="part-heading">
      <h2>Clients</h2>
    </div>

    <p>
      For your Diploma you need to accrue 100 hours with at least one client
      from each of the following age groups:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>3-6 (minimum one long-term client: 20+ sessions)</li>
      <li>6-10 (minimum one long-term client: 20+ sessions)</li>
      <li>10-13 (minimum one long-term client: 20+ sessions)</li>
      <li>13-18 (minimum one short-term client: 6+ sessions)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      It is recommended that you avoid working with children from the same
      class, or with siblings. Initially it is best to avoid working with the
      most complex cases, e.g. children with a known high level of trauma or
      looked after children (your placement setting will be aware of this.) As
      you gain experience and increase your caseload you may be able to work
      with more complexity.
    </p>

    <!-- Section heading -->
    <div class="part-heading">
      <h2>First and second placements</h2>
    </div>

    <p>
      It is usual for your primary (first) placement to be in a primary school
      in order to commence work with the younger age groups where you need
      long-term work. Your secondary (second) placement might be for short-term
      work with teenagers in another setting, or for further long-term work in
      an additional school/organisation working with the younger age groups.
    </p>

    <p>
      We advise you to wait until you have fully settled into your first
      placement before seeking your second placement. Ideally, you should wait
      until you have finished Year 2, before starting your second placement.
    </p>

    <p>
      As you will already have experience by the time you apply for your second
      placement, you can find these settings yourselves, and they don't need to
      meet all of the above requirements. So it's OK if your second placement
      doesn't have an existing counselling/therapy provision.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is not something you need to think about now. It will take time to
      accrue 100 hours and you are not expected or likely to have done all the
      hours by the end of Year 2.
    </p>

    <div class="part-heading">
      <h2>Next steps</h2>
    </div>

    <p>
      In order to begin the process of locating a suitable placement for you,
      please can you complete the placement allocation form:
    </p>

      <a href="{{256901484__Placement allocation form URL}}" class="cta-button"
        >PLACEMENT ALLOCATION FORM</a
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      Please complete it as soon as you are able to, and ideally by [3 weeks
      post-sending].
    </p>

    <!-- Section heading -->
    <div class="part-heading">
      <h2>Placement Agreement</h2>
    </div>

    <p><em>(required only once setting is IATE-approved and confirmed)</em></p>

    <p>
      Once you have a confirmed placement setting, that has been approved and
      agreed by IATE, you will need to sign a placement reciprocal agreement
      together with the placement, before any counselling work commences. Please
      note, this must be signed by both you and the placement director, before
      you start working with any clients on placements. The agreement is digital
      only and can be accessed online by both parties.
    </p>

    <p>You can find this here:</p>

      >
    </p>

    <p>
      I look forward to meeting you at the start of term. Until then, if you
      have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask.
