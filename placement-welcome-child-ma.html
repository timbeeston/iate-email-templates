    <!-- Main content -->
    <p>Dear {{256901484__First name}},</p>

    <p>
      I am writing to introduce myself as your Placement Coordinator for the
      MAICP. I'm looking forward to meeting you on your first day of term, as we
      have a session timetabled dedicated to discussing placements. Until then,
      I am getting in touch to offer some guidance so you can begin thinking
      about your placement.
    </p>

    <!-- Example highlight box -->
    <div class="highlight-box">
      <p>
        Please note this email contains key information and links to essential
        forms - both for setting up your placement, and for use while you're on
        placement.
        <strong>I highly recommend you save this email securely</strong> so you
        can refer back to it when needed.
      </p>

      <h2>Placement Allocation</h2>
    </div>

    <p>
      Below is a link to the placement allocation form, where you can indicate
      your placement availability and preferences. Before completing the form,
      please read the information below carefully as it will give you some
      understanding of how we set up placements, our placement requirements and
      answers to many questions you may have in mind.
    </p>

    <!-- Section heading -->
    <div class="part-heading">
      <h2>Setting up your placement</h2>
    </div>

    <p>
      Your first clinical placement for primary aged children will start in
      January of Year 1 and will be set up by IATE in settings (mostly schools)
      that are approved to meet our course placement requirements. We have many
      existing approved placement settings across the country and can usually
      find you a placement in your region (with some exceptions, where your
      input in the placement search will be necessary).
    </p>

    <p>
      Please note typical travel time to an approved placement may be in the
      region of an hour, though we'll always strive to find you a placement
      within closer reach if we can. If you already work in CAMHS or another
      therapeutic provider, we may also be able to approve that as a placement.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you have another placement setting in mind, there is opportunity for
      you to name the setting on the placement allocation form linked below. We
      can explore it as an option, but please note any new placement setting
      will need to go through an approval process with IATE, as well as meet the
      criteria below:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Has an existing counselling/therapy service in place</li>
      <li>
        Has a person who can act as your placement manager who is a qualified
        counsellor or psychotherapist, available to meet with you weekly and
        complete an annual report
      </li>
      <li>
        Has a dedicated room for your therapy sessions that is free from
        disruption, with art and play materials as well as lockable storage
        space to store confidential artwork and records
      </li>
      <li>
        Opportunity for you to meet parents at least at the beginning and end of
        the work
      </li>
      <li>
        Permission for you to audio-record sessions for supervision and
        assessments
      </li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Section heading -->
    <div class="part-heading">
      <h2>Working on placement</h2>
    </div>

    <p>
      In the first year of your placement you will have a maximum of two
      clients. This increases in your second year to four to six clients, with
      the approval of your supervisor.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sessions are 50 minutes each and you will need time either side to
      prepare, clear up and make notes of the sessions. During your first year,
      therefore, your time commitment on placement is likely to be no more than
      half a day (normally a morning or afternoon) per week.
    </p>

    <p>
      All referrals your placement offers to you, must be approved by your
      supervisor. It is recommended that you avoid working with children from
      the same class, or with siblings. You can't take on complex cases at this
      stage unless you have considerable experience of these client groups
      already, eg looked after children. Due to legislation, you are not allowed
      to work with adopted children.
    </p>

    <p>
      To qualify for UKCP registration, you need to accrue 450 hours. Full
      details of client hours are in the handbook.
    </p>

    <!-- Section heading -->
    <div class="part-heading">
      <h2>Next steps</h2>
    </div>

    <p>
      In order to begin the process of locating a suitable placement for you,
      please complete the placement allocation form:
    </p>

    <!-- Example CTA button -->
    <p>
      <a href="{{256901484__Placement allocation form URL}}" class="cta-button"
        >PLACEMENT ALLOCATION FORM</a
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      Please complete it as soon as you are able to, and ideally by {{PA FORM
      DUE DATE}}.
    </p>

    <!-- Section heading -->
    <div class="part-heading">
      <h2>Placement Agreement</h2>
    </div>

    <p><em>(required only once setting is IATE-approved and confirmed)</em></p>

    <p>
      Once you have a confirmed placement setting, that has been approved and
      agreed by IATE, you will need to sign a placement reciprocal agreement
      together with the placement, before any therapy with clients commences.
      Please note, this must be signed by both you and the placement director,
      before you start working with any clients on placements. The agreement is
      digital only and can be accessed online by both parties.
    </p>

    <p>You can find this here:</p>

    <!-- Example CTA button -->
    <p>
      <a href="{{256901484__Reciprocal agreement form URL}}" class="cta-button"
        >PLACEMENT RECIPROCAL AGREEMENT</a
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      I look forward to meeting you at the start of term. Until then, if you
      have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask.
