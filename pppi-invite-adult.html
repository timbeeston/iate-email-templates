      <h1>UKCP PPPI</h1>
    </div>

    <p>Dear {{248991518__First name (from Student) (from Member)}},</p>

    <p>
      I am writing to let you know that the next round of UKCP registration
      interviews (Personal, Professional Presentation Interviews / PPPIs) are
      being held on <strong>{{248991518__Date}}</strong>. Interviews will be
      held online via Zoom. If you are interested in applying, please read the
      information below for details regarding the fee, documentation required,
      dates/deadlines and how to apply.
    </p>

    <div class="part-heading">
      <h2>What is the PPPI?</h2>
    </div>

    <p>
      To apply for UKCP membership, all IATE graduates must attend a
      Professional Profile Presentation Interview (PPPI) with an External
      Assessor from UKCP.
    </p>

    <p>
      Graduates must complete their PPPI within
      <strong>3 years post-graduation</strong>. The interview can only be
      scheduled when an applicant has completed and passed all assessments and
      accrued the necessary <strong>450 client hours</strong> for UKCP
      registration.
    </p>

    <p>
      The interview will last for 45 minutes and begins with the applicant
      discussing a profile of their work, including practice and its context.
      This enables the applicant to communicate about their approach and what
      the major influences on their own theory and practice are.
    </p>

    <p>
      The External UKCP Assessor has the opportunity to ask a range of questions
      related to subjects that could include:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>ethics</li>
      <li>self-support</li>
      <li>managing clinical work in organisations</li>
      <li>theory</li>
      <li>philosophy</li>
      <li>practice</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The PPPI gives applicants the opportunity to demonstrate their values,
      insights, motivations, clinical competencies, commitment to Continuing
      Professional Development and sense of meaning and purpose in a career as a
      psychotherapist.
    </p>

    <p>
      The External UKCP Assessor will assess whether the applicant demonstrates
      they are 'fit for purpose' in this field, which will then enable the
      applicant to register for full clinical membership with the UKCP.
    </p>

    <div class="part-heading">
      <h2>Fee</h2>
    </div>

    <p>
      The interview fee of <strong>£{{248991518__Fee}}</strong> is due eight
      weeks in advance of the interview date. Organising the interviews is
      dependent on the number of graduates attending and availability of
      assessors. Payment of the fee secures an assessor and time slot for your
      interview.
    </p>

    <div class="highlight-box">
      <p>
        Please note that as a result, this fee will not be refundable or
        transferable (except if an application for extenuating circumstances is
        submitted by the applicant and approved by IATE.)
      </p>
    </div>
    <p></p>
    <div class="highlight-box">
      <p>
        Please note, due to assessor availability, PPPI places are limited and
        will be allocated on a first-come first-served basis. We therefore
        recommend you make payment for your place as soon as you are able to.
        The PPPI assessment takes place every 6 months (in June and December),
        so should you be unsuccessful in securing a place this round, you will
        have the opportunity to reapply in the subsequent round.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="part-heading">
      <h2>Documentation</h2>
    </div>

    <p>
      All applicants will be required to submit their clinical log four weeks in
      advance of the interview date. Please note this log will need to be
      compiled and submitted as per our instructions, linked below in the ‘How
      to Apply’ section (Instructions for Applicants)
    </p>

    <p>
      We strongly advise you to
      <strong>allow two months to complete your log</strong>, as compiling all
      the required information, and in the required order, is a very
      time-consuming process. (If you are unable to do so, we suggest you
      consider deferring your application to the next round, which will take
      place six months later.)
    </p>

      <h2>IATE Membership</h2>
    </div>

    <p>
      To attend the PPPI, your IATE membership must be up-to-date, which
      includes both paying the fee and submitting your annual CPD form. If your
      membership is not up to date, your application will be rejected.
    </p>

    <div class="part-heading">
      <h2>How to Apply</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
      To apply for your PPPI assessment, you will need the following documents:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a
            href="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/iate-org.appspot.com/o/downloads%2FPPPI-Instructions-for-Candidates?alt=media"
            >Instructions for Applications</a

            >Client Hours Record template</a
          >
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p>
      Please ensure you read the Instructions for Applications in full before
      you begin. This will help you in collating the documentation that is
      required for UKCP registration. If your submission does not meet all the
      criteria set out in the instructions, it may be rejected and you may have
      to reapply for the subsequent round of PPPIs, six months later. In this
      instance, as an assessor will already have been booked, fees will
      unfortunately not be transferable.
    </p>

    <p>
      After you have successfully submitted your log, you will be given a time
      slot for your interview approximately 1-2 weeks before the interview date,
      and the Zoom link will be shared with you the day before the interview
      date.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you have any questions about any of the above, please don’t hesitate to
      ask.
